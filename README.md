# COMP129: COMP055 Resurrection Project
## Overview of added feature: Leaderboard
The feature I am planning to add is a leaderboard of scores and initials that will remain even after the game is closed, and be sorted to show only the top five scores. My original group's project was upside-down tetris, and for every line cleared the player received 100 points; therefore, a leaderboard is a very logical step for our game. I plan to add a button to the leaderboard on the main menu screen that will lead the player to the screen, and have the scores appear as GLabels so they can change as the top scores change. 
## Pseudocode
Note: I started coding a little before doing this section of the project; I wanted to cover parts of the code that might result in problems so that I would have time to speak to the professor about them. I needed to manage my time to ensure I would have time to ask the professor. I did not complete the main functionality, I just added buttons and such to prepare for the main functionality.
